## üö® ALERT RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### HIGH SEVERITY ALERTS

#### SPECIFICITY_DEGRADATION (Score < 60%)
**Cause:** Content transmission failure or DeepSeek API issues  
**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check content pipeline: `analyze_files` ‚Üí `enhanced_query` connection
2. Validate file reading and transmission to DeepSeek API
3. Review recent code changes that might affect content processing
4. Execute manual test suite to isolate affected file types

**Recovery Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Run diagnostic test
node test_specific_analysis.js

# 2. Check pipeline health
node quality-monitoring-system.js

# 3. Validate content transmission
node comprehensive-quality-report.js
```

#### CONTENT_TRANSMISSION_FAILURE (Rate < 85%)
**Cause:** Pipeline disconnect or file access issues  
**Immediate Actions:**
1. Verify file system permissions and access
2. Check DeepSeek API connectivity and authentication
3. Validate chunking system functionality (YoutAgent integration)
4. Review error logs for recurring failure patterns

**Recovery Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Test file access and chunking
node youtu-agent-chunking-integration.js

# 2. Validate API connectivity
curl -X POST [DeepSeek API endpoint] -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"

# 3. Run comprehensive pipeline test
node red_phase_test_runner.js
```

### MEDIUM SEVERITY ALERTS

#### RESPONSE_TIME_DEGRADATION (> 5000ms)
**Cause:** API performance issues or system resource constraints  
**Actions:**
1. Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
2. Check DeepSeek API status and response times
3. Review recent changes to chunking or processing logic
4. Consider implementing additional performance optimizations

#### ERROR_RATE_INCREASE (> 25%)
**Cause:** Code changes, API changes, or environmental issues  
**Actions:**
1. Review recent deployments and configuration changes
2. Analyze error logs for common failure patterns
3. Validate test suite against current system behavior
4. Update error handling and recovery mechanisms

## üîß MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES

### Code Change Validation:
**BEFORE** making any changes to the bridge:
1. Run complete test suite: `node test_specific_analysis.js`
2. Execute quality validation: `node quality-monitoring-system.js`  
3. Record baseline metrics for comparison
4. Create backup of current working configuration

**AFTER** making changes:
1. Re-run complete test suite and compare results
2. Validate that specificity scores remain above 60%
3. Confirm content transmission rates above 85%
4. Monitor for 24 hours to detect delayed issues

### Configuration Updates:
- **API Keys:** Ensure DeepSeek API authentication remains valid
- **Endpoints:** Validate API endpoint changes don't break pipeline
- **Timeouts:** Adjust timeout values based on performance monitoring
- **Chunking:** Update chunk size based on API limits and performance

### Test Suite Maintenance:
- **Monthly:** Add new test files representing recent use cases
- **Quarterly:** Review and update expected specifics in test files
- **Annually:** Comprehensive test suite refresh and validation criteria update
