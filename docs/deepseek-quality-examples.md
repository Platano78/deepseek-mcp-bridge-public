## üéØ Overview

This guide shows concrete examples of high-quality vs low-quality DeepSeek responses, based on proven optimization workflows. Use these patterns to evaluate and improve DeepSeek query results.

## Performance Analysis Examples

### ‚úÖ EXCELLENT Response Quality

#### Example: Unity EnemyAI Performance Analysis
**Query:**
```
Analyze EnemyAI.cs for performance bottlenecks. Focus on line-specific issues with exact line numbers and quantified performance impact estimates.
```

**High-Quality Response:**
```
Performance Analysis - EnemyAI.cs:

Line 259: GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>() called in Update()
- Impact: 0.3-0.4ms per frame per enemy
- Issue: Component lookup every frame instead of caching
- Solution: Cache in Start(), save 400+ lookups/second

Line 266: new Vector2(transform.position.x, transform.position.y) 
- Impact: 24 bytes allocation + GC pressure per frame
- Issue: Unnecessary object instantiation for position copy
- Solution: Direct Vector2 assignment, eliminate allocation

Line 279: Vector2.Distance(transform.position, player.position) 
- Impact: 0.1ms per enemy (includes sqrt calculation)
- Issue: Full distance calculation when sqrMagnitude suffices
- Solution: Use Vector2.SqrMagnitude, save 60% computation

Line 298: FindObjectOfType<Player>() in patrol logic
- Impact: 2-3ms per call (scene traversal)
- Issue: Scene search every patrol state check
- Solution: Player reference caching, 99% time reduction

Performance Summary:
- Total estimated improvement: 2.8-3.2ms per enemy per frame
- Critical path: Update() optimization saves 0.5ms baseline
- Memory: Eliminate 24+ bytes allocation per frame
```

#### Why This Is Excellent:
- ‚úÖ **Line-specific**: Exact line numbers (259, 266, 279, 298)
- ‚úÖ **Quantified impact**: Specific millisecond and byte estimates
- ‚úÖ **Technical depth**: Explains root cause (GC pressure, sqrt calculation)
- ‚úÖ **Actionable solutions**: Concrete implementation strategies
- ‚úÖ **Measurable outcomes**: Percentage improvements and time savings

### ‚ùå POOR Response Quality

#### Example: Generic Performance Advice
**Same Query, Poor Response:**
```
The code could be optimized for better performance. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consider caching components instead of calling GetComponent repeatedly
2. Try to avoid creating new objects in Update methods
3. Distance calculations can be expensive, consider alternatives
4. FindObjectOfType calls should be minimized for better performance
5. Overall code structure looks fine but could use some optimization

Performance improvements would help with frame rates and memory usage.
```

#### Why This Is Poor:
- ‚ùå **No line numbers**: "GetComponent repeatedly" - where exactly?
- ‚ùå **No quantification**: "expensive" - how expensive?
- ‚ùå **Generic advice**: "consider alternatives" - which alternatives?
- ‚ùå **No actionable steps**: "should be minimized" - how?
- ‚ùå **Vague outcomes**: "would help" - by how much?

## Code Review Examples

### ‚úÖ EXCELLENT Code Review Quality

#### Example: Null Reference Analysis
**Query:**
```
Review PlayerController.cs for potential null reference exceptions and resource leaks. Provide line-specific findings.
```

**High-Quality Response:**
```
Code Review - PlayerController.cs:

Line 145: playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity;
- Risk: HIGH - playerRigidbody never null-checked after assignment
- Scenario: Component disabled/destroyed during gameplay
- Fix: Add null check or use ?. operator before velocity assignment

Line 203: AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(jumpSound, transform.position);
- Risk: MEDIUM - jumpSound AudioClip could be unassigned in Inspector
- Scenario: Missing audio asset reference causes NullReferenceException  
- Fix: if (jumpSound != null) guard or assign default clip

Line 267: gameObject.GetComponent<Collider2D>().enabled = false;
- Risk: HIGH - GetComponent can return null if component missing
- Scenario: Collider2D accidentally removed from prefab
- Fix: Store reference or null check: ?.enabled = false

Line 312: PlayerPrefs.SetFloat("HighScore", currentScore);
- Risk: LOW - Resource leak concern with frequent PlayerPrefs writes
- Issue: No PlayerPrefs.Save() call, data may not persist
- Fix: Add PlayerPrefs.Save() after score updates

Memory Management:
- Line 89: Event subscription without unsubscription in OnDestroy()
- Line 156: Coroutine started but never stopped on state changes
```

#### Why This Is Excellent:
- ‚úÖ **Risk assessment**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority levels
- ‚úÖ **Scenario-based**: Explains when issues occur
- ‚úÖ **Specific locations**: Exact line numbers and code snippets
- ‚úÖ **Concrete fixes**: Actual code solutions provided
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive scope**: Multiple issue types identified

### ‚ùå POOR Code Review Quality

#### Example: Vague Review Comments
**Same Query, Poor Response:**
```
The code looks mostly good but there are some potential issues:

- Be careful with null references, they can cause crashes
- Make sure to check for missing components  
- Audio clips should probably be validated
- Consider proper resource management
- Event handling might need attention
- Overall structure is reasonable

Some improvements could be made for better reliability and performance.
```

#### Why This Is Poor:
- ‚ùå **No line numbers**: Where are the null reference risks?
- ‚ùå **No specifics**: "Be careful" - about what exactly?
- ‚ùå **No solutions**: "should be validated" - how?
- ‚ùå **No risk levels**: Which issues are critical vs minor?
- ‚ùå **No scenarios**: When do these issues actually occur?

## Debugging Analysis Examples

### ‚úÖ EXCELLENT Debugging Quality

#### Example: Performance Regression Investigation
**Query:**
```
Analyze the performance regression in EnemySpawner.cs. Frame time increased from 12ms to 18ms after recent changes.
```

**High-Quality Response:**
```
Performance Regression Analysis - EnemySpawner.cs:

Root Cause Identification:
Line 178: foreach (var enemy in activeEnemies.ToList())
- Regression: ToList() creates 120-byte copy of 30-enemy collection
- Frequency: Called 3x per frame in Update, Cleanup, and Validate methods
- Impact: 360 bytes allocation + GC overhead = ~2ms regression

Line 203: enemyPool.Where(e => e.gameObject.activeSelf).Count()
- Regression: LINQ query replaces simple counter variable  
- Performance: O(n) traversal of 100-enemy pool vs O(1) counter
- Impact: 100 iterations √ó 0.02ms = 2ms per frame regression

Line 245: GameObject.Instantiate(enemyPrefab) in spawn loop
- Regression: Object pooling removed, direct instantiation added
- Memory pressure: 200KB per enemy √ó 5 spawned = 1MB allocation
- Impact: Major GC spike causing 2-4ms frame time increase

Performance Impact Summary:
- ToList() overhead: ~2ms per frame
- LINQ query regression: ~2ms per frame  
- Instantiation vs pooling: 2-4ms GC spikes
- Total regression: 6-8ms (matches observed 12ms‚Üí18ms increase)

Recommended fixes:
1. Remove ToList() calls, iterate directly over collection
2. Replace LINQ Count() with maintained activeCount variable
3. Restore object pooling system for enemy instantiation
4. Add ProfilerMarkers around each optimization for validation
```

#### Why This Is Excellent:
- ‚úÖ **Root cause analysis**: Identifies exact regression sources
- ‚úÖ **Mathematical validation**: Calculations match observed performance
- ‚úÖ **Impact quantification**: Specific millisecond contributions
- ‚úÖ **Technical depth**: Explains GC behavior and LINQ overhead
- ‚úÖ **Actionable fixes**: Concrete solutions with validation approach

### ‚ùå POOR Debugging Quality

#### Example: Generic Debugging Response
**Same Query, Poor Response:**
```
There seems to be a performance issue in the code. Some possible causes:

- The spawning system might be inefficient
- Memory allocations could be causing problems  
- LINQ operations can sometimes be slow
- Object instantiation patterns may need optimization
- Consider checking for memory leaks

Try to optimize the critical paths and see if performance improves.
Profiling tools might help identify the specific bottlenecks.
```

#### Why This Is Poor:
- ‚ùå **No root cause**: "might be" instead of specific identification
- ‚ùå **No quantification**: Doesn't explain the 6ms regression
- ‚ùå **No specifics**: Which LINQ operations? Where?
- ‚ùå **No validation**: Doesn't match observed performance data
- ‚ùå **Punt to tools**: "use profiling tools" instead of analysis

## Quick Quality Assessment Checklist

### ‚úÖ High-Quality Response Indicators
- [ ] Line numbers specified for every finding
- [ ] Quantified impact estimates (milliseconds, bytes, percentages)
- [ ] Technical explanations for why issues occur
- [ ] Concrete, implementable solutions provided
- [ ] Risk/priority levels assigned to findings
- [ ] Scenario-based explanations of when issues manifest

### ‚ùå Low-Quality Response Warnings
- [ ] Generic advice without line numbers
- [ ] Vague impact descriptions ("expensive", "slow", "might help")
- [ ] No concrete solutions ("consider", "try to", "should")
- [ ] Missing technical depth or explanations
- [ ] Advice to use other tools instead of analysis
- [ ] Placeholder or template-style responses

## Prompt Engineering for Quality

### High-Quality Prompt Pattern
```
Analyze [SPECIFIC_FILE] for [SPECIFIC_ISSUE_TYPE]. Focus on:
- Line-specific issues with exact line numbers
- Quantified performance/memory impact estimates  
- [DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS]

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Line X: [specific issue] - Impact: [quantified estimate]
- Line Y: [specific issue] - Impact: [quantified estimate]

Provide actionable, line-specific findings. No generic advice.
```

### Avoid These Prompt Patterns
```
‚ùå "Check the code for issues"
‚ùå "Optimize this file"
‚ùå "Review for performance problems"
‚ùå "Make this code better"
```

## Validation Techniques

### Response Quality Tests
1. **Line Number Test**: Can you find each issue at the specified line?
2. **Quantification Test**: Are impact estimates specific and measurable?
3. **Actionability Test**: Can you implement the suggested fixes?
4. **Technical Depth Test**: Are explanations technically sound?
5. **Completeness Test**: Are all significant issues identified?

### Re-Query Strategies for Poor Responses
```
# If response lacks line numbers:
"Please provide exact line numbers for each finding in [FILE]."

# If response lacks quantification:
"Estimate the specific performance impact in milliseconds/bytes for each issue."

# If response is too generic:
"Focus on [SPECIFIC_LINES] and provide concrete technical analysis, not general advice."
```
